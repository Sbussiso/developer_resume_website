        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is S'Bussiso Dube and I am a 21 year old passionate developer with roughly six years of programming experience total. It's been a fun hobby of mine since I was a child. I have experience with a variety of programming languages and frameworks.</p>
        
        <p>I am most proficient and have built many applications in Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I am not fully proficient but have some experience working with frameworks like bootstrap, flask, Scikit-Learn, and pandas to name a few.</p>
      
        <p>I'm always eager to learn and improve my skills so I can make better and more useful programs for myself and others. Currently I am beginning to learn C# and improve in JavaScript to expand my project options but python has always been my favorite language.</p>
      
        <p>Machine Learning projects are by far my favorite to work on and excite me the most due to the ever rapidly increasing potential and part of the reason python is my favorite language. I enjoy finding new ways to use and make MLM's, I've made and deployed multiple useful applications using them.</p>
      
        <p>In my free time I like to work on personal projects, game, and practice Taekwondo. I also enjoy other hobbies like working with raspberry pi and arduino boards.</p>
        
        <p>I am a team player and enjoy working collaboratively with others to build innovative solutions. I am committed to delivering high-quality code that is clean, efficient, and scalable.</p>
        
        <p>I am constantly striving to improve my skills and take on new challenges, and I believe that my passion for programming will help me excel in any project or role.</p>

          <h3><a href="https://github.com/Sbussiso/InboxAI.git">inboxAI</a></h3>
          <p>This is the most challenging project I have done to date. 
            inboxAI is an ML driven application created to improve the efficiency of reading and writing emails. 
            This project uses the Open AI GPT-3 api and the Gmail api to briefly summarize large emails and automatically draft responses specific to the senders message. 
            This project was created to save Gmail users a ton of precious time, energy, and resources for a small API fee.</p>

          <h3><a href="https://github.com/Sbussiso/ML-Confidentiality-Detector.git">Sensitive Content Detector</a></h3>
          <p>This project is a little different than other ML projects I have done. 
            This project was an attempt to not use a pre made Model but build and train my own model. 
            This Model is built and trained to read text to flag and identify potentially sensitive/classified information. 
            This project can be used to avoid potentially sensitive data leaks, or find and exploit them.</p>

          <p>This is an application for automatically generating testing and training data for Machine Learning Models. This project uses the GPT-3 api and excel to create entire data sets for users that can then be used to train or test models. The motivation of this project was an attempt to rapidly speed up and take a lot of the work out of supervised learning.</p>
